# Lilith

Lilith is a logging and access event viewer for the Logback logging
framework, log4j and java.util.logging.


It has features comparable to Chainsaw, a logging event viewer for log4j.
This means that it can receive logging events from remote applications using
Logback as their logging backend.


It uses files to buffer the received events locally, so it is possible to
keep vast amounts of logging events at your fingertip while still being able
to check only the ones you are really interested in by using filtering
conditions.


Lilith V8.0.0 has been released on 2015-11-15!
