# Lilith and Mac OS X 10.8

Are you getting this error message in OS X?

![][osx-error]


Don't believe the message. OS X is lying to you. :p


Open "System Preferences" and select "Security & Privacy". On that page, select "Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere".

Open Lilith.app once and answer "Open" to the question.


Open "System Preferences" and select "Security & Privacy". On that page, select "Allow applications downloaded from: Mac App Store and identified developers".

![][osx-enable]


You'll now be able to open Lilith as expected.
